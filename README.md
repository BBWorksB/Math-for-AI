# Math for AI

Welcome to the *Math for AI* repository! This repo serves as a centralized collection of my coursework, assignments, and projects related to mathematics-driven artificial intelligence and engineering applications. It focuses on courses that emphasize the mathematical foundations underpinning AI, machine learning, and stochastic systems, showcasing both theoretical explorations and practical implementations.

## Repository Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my journey through courses that blend mathematics with AI and engineering. Each folder corresponds to a specific course and contains assignments, problem sets, and programming projects that highlight the application of mathematical concepts to real-world problems. This repo is designed to grow over time, incorporating additional courses that explore similar themes.

## Repository Structure

The repo is organized into folders, each representing a course. Currently, it includes:
- **`Applied_Stochastic_Processes`**: Assignments from *18751: Applied Stochastic Processes* (Fall 2024, CMU).
- **`Intro_ML_Engineers`**: Assignments from *18-461/18-661: Introduction to Machine Learning for Engineers* (Spring 2025, CMU).

Future folders will be added as I complete additional relevant courses. Each folder contains my work (e.g., code, write-ups, datasets) along with a brief description of its contents in this README.

## Current Courses
